After you get to manjaro grub menu, instead of pressing enter, press ‘e’ to edit.
Arrow down to linux line.

Remove resume=xxxxxxxxxx, quiet, splash, taking care not to remove others like rw and root=UUID=xxxxxxxxxx
And add ‘3’ (without apostrophes)
You should boot to prompt.
Login with password
Then pacman-mirror/update/upgrade, which is

sudo pacman-mirrors -f3
sudo pacman -Syyuu

Fix what needed to be fix.
And that would be your lightdm.
I don’t have lightdm , but this is what I’d do

sudo pacman -S lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter lightdm-gtk-greeter-settings
sudo systemctl enable lightdm

REBOOT.

ps: If anyone here advises you on lighdm, please follow that person’s advice.
ps: you may also want to check on your graphic drivers, just in case.

sudo lightdm –-test-mode --debug
Have a look at /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log and journalctl -u lightdm
/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf

Change default target to boot into

The standard target is default.target, which is a symlink to graphical.target. This roughly corresponds to the old runlevel 5.

To verify the current target with systemctl:

$ systemctl get-default

To change the default target to boot into, change the default.target symlink. With systemctl:

# systemctl set-default multi-user.target

Removed /etc/systemd/system/default.target.
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/default.target -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/multi-user.target.

Alternatively, append one of the following kernel parameters to your bootloader:

    systemd.unit=multi-user.target (which roughly corresponds to the old runlevel 3),
    systemd.unit=rescue.target (which roughly corresponds to the old runlevel 1).

    lightdm.service

This would explain what is happening.

$ systemctl list-dependencies graphical.target

graphical.target is never reached as the default target is set to multi-user.target
Which also explains the output of "systemctl list-dependencies --reverse lightdm.service" being empty and with nothing depending on lightdm.service systemd will not attempt to start it.
Change_default_target_to_boot_into back to the default of graphical.target should resolve the issue.
